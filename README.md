# SudokuSolver
Sudoku Solver made for my intro to AI class. Done in C++ CodeBlocks.

Will load the initial puzzle from the InputFile. Then the program will attempt to solve the puzzle by using a Naive, and Smart, method. The Naive method will generate the NaiveSolution.txt file and the Smart method will generate the SmartSolution.txt file. The SodukoPuzzles.txt file holds previously tried puzzles and if they were successefully solved.
